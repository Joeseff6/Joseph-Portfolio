          <p class="hero-bio-text">
            My name is Joseph Soria, and welcome to my portfolio! Who am I? I am a University of Houston graduate,
            earning my Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I have worked as a professional
            in the Oil and Gas Industry since 2013, and have experience in Quality and Supply Chain Management.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-bio-text">
            In 2020, I embarked on my journey to explore the world of Fullstack Web Development.
            Joining the bootcamp force, I undertook a Trilogy program that partnered with Rice
            University. Six months later, I graduated the bootcamp with flying colors, making
            great friends and building an impressive Github portfolio in the process.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-bio-text">
            Ever since, I have been creating small projects to hone my skills. My focus was
            in building applications using React.js as my frontend library. I have built
            applications as a Fullstack Developer, coding everything from the frontend to
            the backend.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-bio-text">
            Now I'm preparing for the next big move in my life. I am open to Frontend Development
            opportunities, and I hope that my portfolio speaks to my potential in the industry!
          </p>
