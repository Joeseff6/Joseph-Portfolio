# Welcome to my Portfolio!
This project is powered by Fullpage.js!

By clicking the deployed link, you'll be taken directly to my portfolio. As of 7/12/2022, this is my most recent and most in depth portfolio yet.

I show off my Frontend Developer skills using all custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript (minus CSS and Javascript provided by Fullpage, which gives the scroll functionality). Sass has been utilized to pre-process maintain my CSS, while Javascript is written to control animations and dynamically change content throughout my page.

I hope viewers enjoy!
